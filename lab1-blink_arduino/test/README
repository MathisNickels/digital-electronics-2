### Morse code

1. Listing of C code which repeats one "dot" and one "comma" (BTW, in Morse code it is letter `A`) on a LED. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow C guidelines:

```c
int main(void)
{
    // Set pin where on-board LED is connected as output
    #define LED_RED PB0
    #define PB0 8
    pinMode(LED_RED, OUTPUT);
    digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH);

    // Infinite loop
    while (1)
    {
        digitalWrite(LED_RED, LOW); //I choose to activate the low LED. So I put it low from the start to turn it on.   
        _delay_ms(100); //The letter A in Morse code is a short dot and a stripe. I therefore put a short delay of 100 ms.
        digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH); //I then turn on the LED.
        _delay_ms(100); // Short delay
        digitalWrite(LED_RED, LOW); //The LED is turned on but this time if the delay will be longer because the strip is longer than the point. So we set a delay of 500 ms.
        _delay_ms(500); // Long delay
        digitalWrite(LED_RED, HIGH); //Then the LED is turned off after this delay and a slightly longer delay is set before restarting the loop.
        _delay_ms(250); // delay
    }

    // Will never reach this
    return 0;
}
```

2. Scheme of Morse code application, i.e. connection of AVR device, LED, resistor, and supply voltage. The image can be drawn on a computer or by hand. Always name all components and their values!
